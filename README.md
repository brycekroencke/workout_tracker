# workout tracker

## project breakdown

1. real-time movement detection / classification
2. set and rep tracking for each given movement
3. weight detection (possibly using QR codes on weights or train to learn weights)
4. combine previous steps to show movement, sets/reps, and weight
5. implement using hardware (raspberry pi, laptop, or phone)
