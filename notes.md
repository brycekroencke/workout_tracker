# Workout Tracker Notes

## Movement Classifier
- should be easiest to classify movement type at peak of a rep
- include option to record warmup reps (if no warmups only mark reps at peak weight)

## Bar Tracking

###### Current
- process frames of webcam / vid source
- track user face
- track bar movement and trace line
- simple rep and set counter

###### Future
- find reliable tracking point
- detect start and end of movement


## add feature to update a discord channel
